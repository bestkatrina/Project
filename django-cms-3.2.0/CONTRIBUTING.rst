##########################

Like every open-source project, django CMS is always looking for motivated
individuals to contribute to its source code.

There's more guidance on `how to contribute in our documentation <http://docs.django-cms.org/en/latest/introduction>`_.

Key points:

.. ATTENTION::

    If you think you have discovered a security issue in our code, please report
    it **privately**, by emailing us at `security@django-cms.org`_.

        Please **do not** raise it on:

        * IRC
        * GitHub
        * either of our email lists

        or in any other public forum until we have had a chance to deal with it.

People interested in developing for the django CMS should join the
`django-cms-developers`_ mailing list as well as heading over to #django-cms on
the `freenode`_ IRC network for help and to discuss the development.

You may also be interested in following `@djangocmsstatus`_ on twitter to get
the GitHub commits as well as the hudson build reports. There is also a
`@djangocms`_ account for less technical announcements.
