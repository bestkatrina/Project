Overview
********

django CMS is a modern web publishing platform built with `Django
<https://djangoproject.com/>`_, the web application framework "for
perfectionists with deadlines".

django CMS offers out-of-the-box support for the common features you'd expect
from a CMS, but can also be easily customised and extended by developers to
create a site that is tailored to their precise needs.

**Web content editors** looking for documentation on how to use the editing
interface should refer to our :doc:`/user/index` section.

**Web content developers** who want to learn more about django CMS, as well as
how to install, configure and customise it for their own projects will can
refer to :doc:`/introduction/index`, :doc:`/how_to/index`, :doc:`/topics/index`
and :doc:`/reference/index` sections.

***************
Why django CMS?
***************

django CMS is a well-tested CMS platform that powers sites both large and
small. Here are a few of the key features:

* robust internationalisation (i18n) support for creating multilingual sites
* virtually unlimited undo history, allowing editors to revert to a previous
  version
* front-end editing, providing rapid access to the content management interface
* support for a variety of editors with advanced text editing features.
* a flexible plugins system that lets developers put powerful tools at the
  fingertips of editors, without overwhelming them with a difficult interface

* ...and much more

There are other capable Django-based CMS platforms but here's why you should
consider django CMS:

* thorough documentation
* easy and comprehensive integration into existing projects - django CMS isn't a monolithic application
* a healthy, active and supportive developer community
* a strong culture of good code, including an emphasis on automated testing
